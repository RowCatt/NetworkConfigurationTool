5.2 Network Infrastructure Management and Inventory System
5.2.1 Creating database tables
[x]	Show tables being created (do devices table at end as I know I’ll forget to add some fields)
[x]	Show sample data in Models table
5.2.2 Add device form
[x]	Show web GUI with sample data
[x]	Show PHP code for creating the form
[x]	Show PHP code for error checking
[x]	Show PHP code for sending to Python
5.2.3 Device connection
[x]	Python accepting PHP code and using Netmiko to attempt a connection
[x]	Exception if connection fails
[x]	Successful connection
5.2.4 Configuration download and analysis
[x]	Download running config from device
[x]	Extracting key data
[x]	Creating an entry in the Devices table and inserting the config
[x]	Insert full config backup into ‘Configuration’ table
[]	Show web GUI with device details
5.2.5 Periodic device connection testing
[x]	Create a python script to periodically use Netmiko to attempt to connect to devices in the ‘Devices’ table
[x]	If a connection fails: add an error flag to the db. if succeeds: remove flag
[]	Add this to crontab to run every minute
[x]	Error flag shown in web GUI

5.3 Automated Device Configuration
5.3.1 Web form creation
[x]	Create ‘Global configuration’ web form
[x]	Error checking using PHP
[x]	Prompt user to re-enter details if there is an error
5.3.2 Database interaction
[x]	Create a ‘Global config’ DB table
[x]	Insert error checked config with PHP
[x]	Add flag to ‘Devices’ table to enable global config applying
5.3.3 Integration with periodic device connection script
[x]	Add to python cron task – if flagged in devices table
[x]	If current config is different, create backup of config
[x]	Apply global config

5.4 Network Configuration Management
5.4.1 Dynamic Edit Configuration page creation
[x]	Add a dynamic edit config page for each device
[x]	Populate page with config stored in the db
[x]	Add checkbox for allowing automated / global config
[x]	If checked (default), global config flag is applied to device
[x]	If unchecked, unlocks fields using under global conf for user to enter details
5.4.2 Applying configuration to devices
[x]	PHP sends config to Python
[x]	Python connects to device using Netmiko
[x]	If config has changed (new conf vs conf in devices table):
[x]	Take a backup of the current config
[x]	Apply the new config
[x]	Else: Don’t apply the config – nothing to change
5.4.3 Rolling back to previous configuration
[]	Show all configuration backups for a device in the edit config page
[]	A user can select a config to roll back to
[]	Show PHP and python/Netmiko applying this config

5.5 VLAN Management
[]	Add VLAN Management page attached to Global conf page
[]	Allow users to add/remove VLANs from the list
[]	Users can edit the names of VLANs
[]	Can set native vlan
[]	Create ‘vlan’ table in database
[]	Once saved: drop and repopulate vlan table
[]	Add to the periodic device connection, replace the VLANs if global conf enabled
